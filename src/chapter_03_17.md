## MIL-STD-1760D

Prior to the implmentation of MIL-STD-1760, aircraft and stores were developed independently. This, of course resulted in unique aircraft/store electrical interconnection requirements which varied from aircraft to aircraft. The gaol of the standard was to make aircraft which were compatable with a wide variety of stores and make stores that were compatabile with a large varitey of aircraft. 

MIL-STD-1760D defines a standard that electrical (and optical) interconnection systems for aircraft and stores. The system is based off a standar connector, a standard signal set, and a stanardard serial digital interfaces for control, monitoring, and realese of stores. 

Stanard interfaces

* Aircarft station interface (ASI)
* Mission store interface (MSI)
* Carriage store interface (CSI)
* Routing network aircraft system port (RNASP)
